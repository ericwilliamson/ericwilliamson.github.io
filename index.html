                <h4>Customer focused engineering leader.</h4>

                <p>
                    I began my career as a self-taught programmer working with classic ASP. I gained significant
                    experience with .Net, and eventually moved into the mobile world, working as a Senior Blackberry
                    Developer for 3+ years. From Blackberry I moved on to iOS, becoming fluent in Objective-C and honed
                    strong scripting skills with Python. While working as a consultant, I discovered my passion for
                    automation and joined Puppet, where I have been for the last 10 years. During my time at Puppet, my
                    customer first development values only grew stronger as I worked closely with the field and customer
                    support teams.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whether working as a trusted advisor to a client, or directly with senior leadership, I make their
                    desired business outcomes my highest priority. I am comfortable in an agency environment or a fast
                    paced start-up, and I can easily contribute solid ideas on design and implementation. I have a
                    successful track record for effectively managing schedules, meeting demanding deadlines and for
                    completing projects on time and within budget guidelines. In delivery of services, I am able to add
                    value through my strong belief in issue ownership from identification through resolution, my ability
                    to troubleshoot in multi-tier architectures, through providing effective classroom instruction to
                    customers, and by mentoring less experienced constituents.

                        <p>Puppet is the industry-leading automation solution for configuration management, compliance,

                        <p>
                            Worked closely with executives to integrate an acquired companies technology stack and pivot
                            to offering a brand new product - Continuous delivery for Puppet Enterprise. Within a year,
                            the product had grown to be the companies number two earner.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the team and tech lead, some of my roles and responsibilities include:
                        </p>
                        <p> - Working with all disciplines to define feature specs for the team to implement. </p>
                        <p> - Lead agile rituals. </p>
                        <p> - Working with management to ensure all team members had growth opportunities in line with
                            their goals. </p>
                        <p> - Mentor team members.</p>
                        <p> - Work with product on determining feasibility of road map items 6+ mo out.</p>

                        <p><b>Other highlights of my time at Puppet</b></p>
                        <p> - Worked directly with the Chief Architect and VP of Product, I architected, prototyped and
                            then lead a small team to implement a new micro-service SaaS based approach to puppet
                            products. Within two months, had a fully functional MVP product complete with CI/CD auto
                            deploying to GKE on every commit.
                        </p>
                        <p> - Worked with field solutions, designed, developed and pitched a redesign of the Puppet
                            Enterprise Installer. Once adopted, support escalations were reduced by over 70% on install
                            and upgrade issues.
                        </p>
                        <p> - Worked with field solutions to design and develop a new scaling solution that removed the
                            need for a team to produce 40 page google docs on how to scale, to a simple 2 step process
                            that automated all of it.
                        </p>
                        <p> - Prototyped and pitched to engineering leadership a need for a temporary team to tackle CI
                            issues and short comings. As part of this work, created internal tooling that allowed people
                            to know what code was in what build. Redesigned the initial CI matrix to reduce time to
                            feedback from days to 1 hour.

                            customers, which allows him and his team to improve their products and drive greater demand.

                            this point. Eric's ability to learn new technologies and languages quickly is a testament to
