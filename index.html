                <p>
                    With 16 years of experience as a software engineer, I have a strong customer focus and
                    results-oriented approach. I possess a track record of leading and mentoring teams, delivering
                    top-notch software solutions, and collaborating effectively with stakeholders and executives. My
                    ability to learn new technologies quickly and make meaningful contributions to project success has
                    been demonstrated throughout my career.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an engineering leader at Puppet, I was involved in a wide range of initiatives, such as
                    integrating an acquired company's technology stack, prototyping and implementing new microservices,
                    and designing and developing new scaling solutions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Overall, I am passionate about working on cutting-edge technologies and contributing to the
                    development of innovative products that make a difference. I am confident that my skills and
                    expertise make me a strong candidate for any software engineering position.
