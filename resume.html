            <h4>Specializing in iOS, Python and DevOps technology.</h4>

            <p>
                A Scottsdale, Arizona-based freelance developer and consultant with over 10 years of experience and
                strong DevOps awareness and orientation; Specializing in building websites in .NET and Python and
                end-to-end development of mobile applications for iPhone and iPad.
            </p>

            <h4>Background</h4>

            <p>
                I began my career as a self-taught programmer working with classic ASP. I gained significant
                experience with .Net, and eventually moved into the mobile world, working as a Senior Blackberry
                Developer for 3+ years. From Blackberry I moved on to iOS, becoming fluent in Objective-C and honed
                strong scripting skills with Python. For the last 3 years I have focused on consulting by creating,
                providing pre-sales technical support and developing performance enhancements for mobile
                applications.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a trusted advisor to my clients, I make their desired business outcomes my highest priority. I am
                comfortable in an agency environment or a fast paced start-up, and I can easily contribute solid
                ideas on design and implementation. I have a successful track record for effectively managing
                schedules, meeting demanding deadlines and for completing projects on time and within budget
                guidelines. In delivery of services, I am able to add value through my strong belief in issue
                ownership from identification through resolution, my ability to troubleshoot in multi-tier
                architectures, through providing effective classroom instruction to customers, and by mentoring less
                experienced constituents.
